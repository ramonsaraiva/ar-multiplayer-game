# Augmented Reality Multiplayer Shooter

This is a proof of concept, the codebase might be really messy.

## How it works

With a set of cards (board, obstacles, spawns, etc..), one (or more) player(s) can set up an augmented reality level, with different obstacles and monster spawn points. When the level is ready, the other player will be spawned and needs to survive, shooting monsters that will spawn according to the level.

## Multiplayer

The first user that opens the game automatically connects to a server and a room will be available for the incoming players. If both (or all) players have the cards, they can play it in different places, the whole arena and monsters/players will be synced up through the network.
