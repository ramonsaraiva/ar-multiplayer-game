# Augmented Reality Multiplayer Shooter

## How it works

With a set of cards (board, obstacles, spawns, etc..), one (or more) player(s) can set up an augmented reality level, with different obstacles and monster spawn points. When the level is ready, the other player will be spawned and needs to survive, shooting monsters that will spawn according to the level.
